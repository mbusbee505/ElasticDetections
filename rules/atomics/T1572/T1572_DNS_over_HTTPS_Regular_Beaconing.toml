Test Description: This test simulates an infected host beaconing via DoH queries to a command and control server at regular intervals over time.\nThis behaviour is typical of implants either in an idle state waiting for instructions or configured to use a low query volume over time to evade threshold based detection.\nA custom domain and sub-domain will need to be passed as input parameters for this test to work. Upon execution, DNS information about the domain will be displayed for each callout in a JSON format..
