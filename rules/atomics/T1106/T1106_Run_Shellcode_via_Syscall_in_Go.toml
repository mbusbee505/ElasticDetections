Test Description: Runs shellcode in the current running process via a syscall.\n\nSteps taken with this technique\n1. Allocate memory for the shellcode with VirtualAlloc setting the page permissions to Read/Write\n2. Use the RtlCopyMemory macro to copy the shellcode to the allocated memory space\n3. Change the memory page permissions to Execute/Read with VirtualProtect\n4. Use syscall to execute the entrypoint of the shellcode\n\n- PoC Credit: (https://github.com/Ne0nd0g/go-shellcode#syscall).
