description = "Detection for specific test 'Dump Credential Manager using keymgr.dll and rundll32.exe' (GUID: 84113186-ed3c-4d0d-8a3c-8980c86c1f4a) of technique T1003 (OS Credential Dumping). Test Description: This test executes the exported function `KRShowKeyMgr` located in `keymgr.dll` using `rundll32.exe`. It opens a window that allows to export stored Windows credentials from the credential manager to a file (`.crd` by default). The file can then be retrieved and imported on an attacker-controlled computer to list the credentials get the passwords. The only limitation is that it requires a CTRL+ALT+DELETE input from the attacker, which can be achieve multiple ways (e.g. a custom implant with remote control capabilities, enabling RDP, etc.).\nReference: https://twitter.com/0gtweet/status/1415671356239216653. Command/Steps: rundll32.exe keymgr,KRShowKeyMgr"
