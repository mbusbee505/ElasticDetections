Test Description: Bypass UAC using SilentCleanup task on Windows 8-10 using bat file from https://www.reddit.com/r/hacking/comments/ajtrws/bypassing_highest_uac_level_windows_810/\n\nThere is an auto-elevated task called SilentCleanup located in %windir%\\\\system32\\\\cleanmgr.exe This can be abused to elevate any file with Administrator privileges without prompting UAC (even highest level).\n\nFor example, we can set the windir registry kye to: \\\"cmd /k REM \\\"\n\nAnd forcefully run SilentCleanup task:\n\nschtasks /run /tn \\\\Microsoft\\\\Windows\\\\DiskCleanup\\\\SilentCleanup /I\n\nREM will tell it to ignore everything after %windir% and treat it just as a NOTE. Therefore just executing cmd with admin privs.. Command/Steps: \\\"#{file_path}\\\"\n"
