description = "Detection for specific test 'HKLM - Add atomic_test key to launch executable as part of user setup' (GUID: deff4586-0517-49c2-981d-bbea24d48d71) of technique T1547.014 (Active Setup). Test Description: This test will create an \\\"atomic_test\\\" key under 'HKLM:\\\\SOFTWARE\\\\Microsoft\\\\Active Setup\\\\Installed Components' to launch calc by configuring an active setup executable and \nforcing to run active setup using the \\\"runonce.exe /AlternateShellStartup\\\" command. \nWithout the \\\"runonce.exe /AlternateShellStartup\\\" command it would run during the next logon for each user.\n\nNote: If you logout before running the cleanup command, you will be required to go through the OOBE (out-of-box experience) setup sequence to log back in. \nThe payload will only run once unless the cleanup command is run in between tests.\n\n[Active Setup Explained](https://helgeklein.com/blog/active-setup-explained/).
