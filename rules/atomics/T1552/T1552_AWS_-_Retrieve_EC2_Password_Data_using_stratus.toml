Test Description: This atomic runs an API call GetPasswordData from a role that does not have permission to do so. This simulates an attacker attempting to retrieve RDP passwords on a high number of Windows EC2 instances. This atomic test leverages a tool called stratus-red-team built by DataDog (https://github.com/DataDog/stratus-red-team). Stratus Red Team is a self-contained binary. You can use it to easily detonate offensive attack techniques against a live cloud environment. Ref: https://stratus-red-team.cloud/attack-techniques/AWS/aws.credential-access.ec2-get-password-data/. Command/Steps: export AWS_REGION=#{aws_region} \ncd #{stratus_path}\necho \\\"starting warmup\\\"\n./stratus warmup aws.credential-access.ec2-get-password-data\necho \\\"starting..."
