Test Description: This test is a Powershell script that enumerates Active Directory to determine computers that are joined to the domain. \nThis test is designed to mimic how SessionGopher can determine the additional systems within a domain, which has been used before by threat actors to aid in lateral movement. \nReference: [Head Fake: Tackling Disruptive Ransomware Attacks](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/head-fake-tackling-disruptive-ransomware-attacks). \nUpon successful execution, this test will output the names of the computers that reside on the domain to the console window.. Command/Steps: $DirectorySearcher = New-Object System.DirectoryServices.DirectorySearcher(\\\"(ObjectCategory=Computer)\\\")\n$DirectorySearcher.PropertiesToLoad.Add(\\\"Name\\\"..."
