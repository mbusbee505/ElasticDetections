Test Description: A Base64 Encoded command will be stored in the registry (ping 127.0.0.1) and then a scheduled task will be created.\nThe scheduled task will launch powershell to decode and run the command in the registry daily.\nThis is a persistence mechanism recently seen in use by Qakbot.  \n\n[Additiona Information](https://thedfirreport.com/2022/02/07/qbot-likes-to-move-it-move-it/).
