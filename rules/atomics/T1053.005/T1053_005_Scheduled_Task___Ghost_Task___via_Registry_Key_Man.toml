description = "Detection for specific test 'Scheduled Task (\\\"Ghost Task\\\") via Registry Key Manipulation' (GUID: 704333ca-cc12-4bcf-9916-101844881f54) of technique T1053.005 (Scheduled Task/Job: Scheduled Task). Test Description: Create a scheduled task through manipulation of registry keys. This procedure is implemented using the [GhostTask](https://github.com/netero1010/GhostTask) utility. By manipulating registry keys under HKLM\\\\SOFTWARE\\\\Microsoft\\\\Windows NT\\\\CurrentVersion\\\\Schedule\\\\TaskCache\\\\Tree, the tool creates user-specified scheduled tasks without a corresponding Windows Event 4698, which is logged when scheduled tasks are created through conventional means.\nThis requires a download of the GhostTask binary, which must be run as NT Authority\\\\SYSTEM. Upon successful execution of this test, a scheduled task will be set to run at logon which launches notepad.exe or runs a user-specified command.\nFor further exploration of this procedure and guidance for hunting and detection, see [Hunting G-G-G-GhostTasks!](https://medium.com/p/154b50ab6a78)..
