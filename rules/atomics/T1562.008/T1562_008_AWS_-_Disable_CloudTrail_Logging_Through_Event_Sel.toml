Test Description: Update event selectors in AWS CloudTrail to disable the logging of certain management events to evade defense. This Atomic test leverages a tool called Stratus-Red-Team built by DataDog (https://github.com/DataDog/stratus-red-team). Stratus Red Team is a self-contained binary. You can use it to easily detonate offensive attack techniques against a live cloud environment.
