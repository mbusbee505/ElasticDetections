description = "Detection for specific test 'Create/Append to .bash_logout' (GUID: 37ad2f24-7c53-4a50-92da-427a4ad13f58) of technique T1546.004 (Event Triggered Execution: .bash_profile .bashrc and .shrc). Test Description: The Bash shell runs ~/.bash_logout \\\"if it exists\\\" to run commands on user logout. An adversary may create or append to a .bash_logout to clear history, start processes etc. Note the ~/.bash_logout is only run if you explicitly exit or log out of an \\\"interactive login shell session\\\" i.e. via the console, SSH, /bin/bash -l or su -l <username>. \n\nThis test creates the art user, logs in, creates a .bash_logout which will echo some text into the art.txt file on logout and logs out and the /home/art/art.txt is created.. Command/Steps: useradd --create-home --shell /bin/bash art\nsu -l art -c \\\"echo 'echo \\\\\\\"Atomic Red Team was here... T1546.004\\\\\\\" >> /home/art/art.txt' >> /home/art/.bas..."
