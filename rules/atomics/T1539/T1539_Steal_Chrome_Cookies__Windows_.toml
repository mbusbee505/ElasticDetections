description = "Detection for specific test 'Steal Chrome Cookies (Windows)' (GUID: 26a6b840-4943-4965-8df5-ef1f9a282440) of technique T1539 (Steal Web Session Cookie). Test Description: This test queries Chrome's SQLite database to steal the encrypted cookie data, designed to function similarly to Zloader/Zbot's cookie theft function. \nOnce an adversary obtains the encrypted cookie info, they could go on to decrypt the encrypted value, potentially allowing for session theft. \nNote: If Chrome is running, the process will be killed to ensure that the DB file isn't locked. \nSee https://www.malwarebytes.com/resources/files/2020/05/the-silent-night-zloader-zbot_final.pdf..
