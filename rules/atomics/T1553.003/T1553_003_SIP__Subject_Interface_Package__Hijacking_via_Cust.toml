Test Description: Registers a DLL that logs signature checks, mimicking SIP hijacking. This test uses a DLL from \nhttps://github.com/gtworek/PSBits/tree/master/SIP and registers it using regsvr32, thereby causing\nthe system to utilize it during signature checks, and logging said checks.. Command/Steps: regsvr32.exe #{dll_payload}\n"
