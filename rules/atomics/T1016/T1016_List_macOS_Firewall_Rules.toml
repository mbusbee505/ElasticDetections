description = "Detection for specific test 'List macOS Firewall Rules' (GUID: ff1d8c25-2aa4-4f18-a425-fede4a41ee88) of technique T1016 (System Network Configuration Discovery). Test Description: \\\"This will test if the macOS firewall is enabled and/or show what rules are configured. Must be run with elevated privileges. Upon successful execution, these commands will output various information about the firewall configuration, including status and specific port/protocol blocks or allows. \n\nUsing `defaults`, additional arguments can be added to see filtered details, such as `globalstate` for global configuration (\\\\\\\"Is it on or off?\\\\\\\"), `firewall` for common application allow rules, and `explicitauths` for specific rules configured by the user. \n\nUsing `socketfilterfw`, flags such as --getglobalstate or --listapps can be used for similar filtering. At least one flag is required to send parseable output to standard out.. Command/Steps: sudo defaults read /Library/Preferences/com.apple.alf\nsudo /usr/libexec/ApplicationFirewall/socketfilterfw --getglobalstate\n"
