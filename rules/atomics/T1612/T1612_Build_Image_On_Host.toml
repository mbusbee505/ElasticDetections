description = "Detection for specific test 'Build Image On Host' (GUID: 2db30061-589d-409b-b125-7b473944f9b3) of technique T1612 (Build Image on Host). Test Description: Adversaries may build a container image directly on a host to bypass defenses that monitor for the retrieval of malicious images from a public registry. An adversary may take advantage of that build API to build a custom image on the host that includes malware downloaded from their C2 server, and then they then may utilize Deploy Container using that custom image.. Command/Steps: docker build -t t1612  $PathtoAtomicsFolder/T1612/src/\ndocker run --name t1612_container --rm -d -t t1612\ndocker exec t1612_container ./test.sh"
