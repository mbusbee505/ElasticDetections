description = "Detection for specific test 'Bash session based keylogger' (GUID: 7f85a946-a0ea-48aa-b6ac-8ff539278258) of technique T1056.001 (Input Capture: Keylogging). Test Description: When a command is executed in bash, the BASH_COMMAND variable contains that command. For example :~$ echo $BASH_COMMAND = \\\"echo $BASH_COMMAND\\\". The trap command is not a external command, but a built-in function of bash and can be used in a script to run a bash function when some event occurs. trap will detect when the BASH_COMMAND variable value changes and then pipe that value into a file, creating a bash session based keylogger. \n\nTo gain persistence the command could be added to the users .bashrc or .bash_aliases or the systems default .bashrc in /etc/skel/. Command/Steps: trap 'echo \\\"$(date +\\\"%d/%m/%y %H:%M:%S.%s\\\") $USER $BASH_COMMAND\\\" >> #{output_file}' DEBUG\necho \\\"Hello World!\\\"\ncat #{output_file}\n"
