Test Description: An Adversary may clear, unset or redirect the history environment variable HISTFILE to prevent logging of commands to the history file after they log out of the system.\n\nNote: we don't wish to log out, so we are just confirming the value of HISTFILE. In this test we 1. echo HISTFILE 2. set it to /dev/null 3. confirm that HISTFILE is set to /dev/null.. Command/Steps: echo $HISTFILE\nexport HISTFILE=\\\"/dev/null\\\"\nif [ $(echo $HISTFILE) == \\\"/dev/null\\\" ]; then echo \\\"\\\\$HISTFILE is /dev/null\\\"; fi\n"
