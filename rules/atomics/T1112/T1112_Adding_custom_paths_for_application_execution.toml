Test Description: As per Microsoft,the entries found under App Paths are used primarily to map an application’s executable file name to that file’s fully qualified path and to pre-pend information to the PATH environment variable on a per-application, per-process basis. \nThe path can be modified to load a custom application of choice. \nPost the registry changes of this test, when someone tries to manually run msedge.exe via StartMenu/Run window , notepad will be launched.. Command/Steps: reg add \\\"HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\\\SOFTWARE\\\\Microsoft\\\\Windows\\\\CurrentVersion\\\\App Paths\\\\#{app_name}\\\" /t REG_SZ /d #{new_path} /f\n"
