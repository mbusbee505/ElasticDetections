Test Description: The following Atomic Test creates a registry blob in HKLM:\\\\SOFTWARE\\\\Classes\\\\.wav\\\\OpenWithProgIds, which is related to Snake Malware. Per the report, upon execution, Snake's WerFault.exe will attempt to decrypt an encrypted blob within the Windows\nregistry that is typically found at HKLM:\\\\SOFTWARE\\\\Classes\\\\.wav\\\\OpenWithProgIds. The encrypted data includes the AES key, IV, and path that is used to find and decrypt the file containing Snake's kernel driver and kernel driver loader.. Command/Steps: $typicalPath = \\\"HKLM:\\\\SOFTWARE\\\\Classes\\\\.wav\\\\OpenWithProgIds\\\"; $randomBytes = New-Object Byte[] 0x1000; (New-Object Random).NextBytes($randomBytes); Ne..."
