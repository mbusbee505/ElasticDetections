description = "Detection for specific test 'Process Injection with Go using CreateThread WinAPI (Natively)' (GUID: 2a3c7035-d14f-467a-af94-933e49fe6786) of technique T1055 (Process Injection). Test Description: This program executes shellcode in the current process using the following steps\n1. Allocate memory for the shellcode with VirtualAlloc setting the page permissions to Read/Write\n2. Use the RtlCopyMemory macro to copy the shellcode to the allocated memory space\n3. Change the memory page permissions to Execute/Read with VirtualProtect\n4. Call CreateThread on shellcode address\n5. Call WaitForSingleObject so the program does not end before the shellcode is executed\n\nThis program loads the DLLs and gets a handle to the used procedures itself instead of using the windows package directly.\n\n- PoC Credit: (https://github.com/Ne0nd0g/go-shellcode#createthreadnative).
