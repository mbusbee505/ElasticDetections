Test Description: Solarigate persistence is achieved via backdoors deployed via various techniques including using PowerShell with an EncodedCommand\n Powershell -nop -exec bypass -EncodedCommand <encoded command>\nWhere the –EncodedCommand, once decoded, would resemble:\n  Invoke-WMIMethod win32_process -name create -argumentlist ‘rundll32 c:\\\\windows\\\\idmu\\\\common\\\\ypprop.dll _XInitImageFuncPtrs’ -ComputerName WORKSTATION\nThe EncodedCommand in this atomic is the following: Invoke-WmiMethod -Path win32_process -Name create -ArgumentList notepad.exe\nYou should expect to see notepad.exe running after execution of this test.\n[Solarigate Analysis from Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2020/12/18/analyzing-solorigate-the-compromised-dll-file-that-started-a-sophisticated-cyberattack-and-how-microsoft-defender-helps-protect/).
