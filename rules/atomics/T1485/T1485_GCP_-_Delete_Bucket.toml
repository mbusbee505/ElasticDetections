Test Description: This Atomic will create a Google Storage Bucket then delete it. The idea for this Atomic came from a Rule published by the Elastic team.\n\nIdentifies when a Google Cloud Platform (GCP) storage bucket is deleted. An adversary may delete a storage bucket in order to disrupt their target's business operations.\nThis atomic will create a bucket then delete the bucket.\n\nReference: https://github.com/elastic/detection-rules/blob/main/rules/integrations/gcp/impact_gcp_storage_bucket_deleted.toml. Command/Steps: gcloud config set project #{project_id}\ngcloud storage buckets delete gs://#{bucket_name}\n"
