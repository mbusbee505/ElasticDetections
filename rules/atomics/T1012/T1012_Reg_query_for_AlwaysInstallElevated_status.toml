description = "Detection for specific test 'Reg query for AlwaysInstallElevated status' (GUID: 6fb4c4c5-f949-4fd2-8af5-ddbc61595223) of technique T1012 (Query Registry). Test Description: The reg query commands allows to check the status of the AlwaysInstallElevated registry key for both the user and the machine. If both queries return a value of 0x1, then AlwaysInstallElevated is enabled for both user and machine thus allowing a regular user to install a Microsoft Windows Installer package with system level privileges. This can be abused by an attacker to escalate privileges in the host to SYSTEM level.. Command/Steps: reg query HKCU\\\\SOFTWARE\\\\Policies\\\\Microsoft\\\\Windows\\\\Installer /v AlwaysInstallElevated\nreg query HKLM\\\\SOFTWARE\\\\Policies\\\\Microsoft\\\\Windows\\\\Installer /v ..."
