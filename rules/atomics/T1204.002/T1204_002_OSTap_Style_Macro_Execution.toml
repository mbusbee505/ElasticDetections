Test Description: This Test uses a VBA macro to create and execute #{jse_path} with cscript.exe. Upon execution, the .jse file launches wscript.exe.\nExecution is handled by [Invoke-MalDoc](https://github.com/redcanaryco/invoke-atomicredteam/blob/master/Public/Invoke-MalDoc.ps1) to load and execute VBA code into Excel or Word documents.\nThis is a known execution chain observed by the OSTap downloader commonly used in TrickBot campaigns.\nReferences:\n  https://www.computerweekly.com/news/252470091/TrickBot-Trojan-switches-to-stealthy-Ostap-downloader.
