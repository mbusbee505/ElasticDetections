Test Description: This module creates an Excel 4 Macro (XLM) enabled spreadsheet and executes it. The XLM will first write a \\\"malicious\\\"\nVBS file to %TEMP%, then execute this file.

By default, this module will pull the current username from the system and places it into the macro. If\nyou'd like to utilize the \\\"=GET.WORKSPACE(26)\\\" method, that many maldoc authors use, you will need to ensure that the User Name associated\nwith Excel matches that of the local system. This username can be found under Files -> Options -> Username.
