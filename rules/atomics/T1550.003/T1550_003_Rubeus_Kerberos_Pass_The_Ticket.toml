Test Description: Requesting a TGT on a remote system and retrieving it locally before requesting a service ticket with it. This is a Pass-The-Ticket attack because the TGT is obtained on the remote system, then used from a different machine (local).\nPsExec is used to execute commands on the remote system, and the \\\"C$\\\" admin share is used to retrieve the TGT, so the current user must have admin rights remotely and other PsExec prerequisites must be met..
