Test Description: Look for the encrypted cpassword value within Group Policy Preference files on the Domain Controller.\nThis test is intended to be run from a domain joined workstation, not on the Domain Controller itself.\nThe Get-GPPPasswords.ps1 executed during this test can be obtained using the get-prereq_commands.\n\nSuccessful test execution will either display the credentials found in the GPP files or indicate \\\"No preference files found\\\".. Command/Steps: . \\\"#{gpp_script_path}\\\"\nGet-GPPPassword -Verbose\n"
