Test Description: Invokes the command line similar to that used by Ryuk Ransomware to grant full access to the entire C:\\\\ drive for Everyone.\n**icacls \\\"C:\\\\*\\\" /grant Everyone:F /T /C /Q**\nHowever, for this atomic we set the permission on C:\\\\Users\\\\Public so it completes faster and doesn't irreversibly affect the host.\nYou can set your own path variable to \\\"C:\\\\*\\\" if you prefer.. Command/Steps: icacls \\\"#{path}\\\" /grant Everyone:F /T /C /Q"
