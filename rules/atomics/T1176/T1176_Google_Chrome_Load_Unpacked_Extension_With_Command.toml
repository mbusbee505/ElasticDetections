Test Description: This test loads an unpacked extension in Google Chrome with the `--load-extension` parameter. This technique was previously used by the Grandoreiro malware to load a malicious extension that would capture the browsing history, steal cookies and other user information. Other malwares also leverage this technique to hijack searches, steal passwords, inject ads, and more.\n\nReferences:\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1176/\nhttps://securityintelligence.com/posts/grandoreiro-malware-now-targeting-banks-in-spain/.
