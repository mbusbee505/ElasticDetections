Test Description: The memory of lsass.exe is often dumped for offline credential theft attacks. This can be achieved using direct system calls and API unhooking in an effort to avoid detection. \nhttps://github.com/outflanknl/Dumpert\nhttps://outflank.nl/blog/2019/06/19/red-team-tactics-combining-direct-system-calls-and-srdi-to-bypass-av-edr/\nUpon successful execution, you should see the following file created C:\\\\\\\\windows\\\\\\\\temp\\\\\\\\dumpert.dmp.\n\nIf you see a message saying \\\\\\\"The system cannot find the path specified.\\\\\\\", try using the  get-prereq_commands to download the  tool first..
