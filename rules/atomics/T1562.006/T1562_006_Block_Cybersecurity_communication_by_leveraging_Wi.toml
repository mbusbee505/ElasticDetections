Test Description: Adversaries are redirecting DNS queries to an incorrect or malicious DNS server IP, thereby blocking legitimate communications and potentially compromising the security infrastructure. This atomic test aims to respond with 127.0.0.1 when a DNS query is made for endpoint.security.microsoft.com..
