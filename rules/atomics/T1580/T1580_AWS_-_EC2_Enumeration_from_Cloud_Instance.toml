description = "Detection for specific test 'AWS - EC2 Enumeration from Cloud Instance' (GUID: 99ee161b-dcb1-4276-8ecb-7cfdcb207820) of technique T1580 (Cloud Infrastructure Discovery). Test Description: This atomic runs several API calls (sts:GetCallerIdentity, s3:ListBuckets, iam:GetAccountSummary, iam:ListRoles, iam:ListUsers, iam:GetAccountAuthorizationDetails, ec2:DescribeSnapshots, cloudtrail:DescribeTrails, guardduty:ListDetectors) from the context of an EC2 instance role. This simulates an attacker compromising an EC2 instance and running initial discovery commands on it. This atomic test leverages a tool called stratus-red-team built by DataDog (https://github.com/DataDog/stratus-red-team). Stratus Red Team is a self-contained binary. You can use it to easily detonate offensive attack techniques against a live cloud environment. Ref: https://stratus-red-team.cloud/attack-techniques/AWS/aws.discovery.ec2-enumerate-from-instance/.
