Test Description: This test adds a shared library to the `ld.so.preload` list to execute and intercept API calls. This technique was used by threat actor Rocke during the exploitation of Linux web servers. This requires the `glibc` package.\n\nUpon successful execution, bash will echo `../bin/T1574.006.so` to /etc/ld.so.preload.. Command/Steps: sudo sh -c 'echo #{path_to_shared_library} > /etc/ld.so.preload'\n"
