description = "Detection for specific test 'Shared Library Injection via LD_PRELOAD' (GUID: bc219ff7-789f-4d51-9142-ecae3397deae) of technique T1574.006 (Hijack Execution Flow: LD_PRELOAD). Test Description: This test injects a shared object library via the LD_PRELOAD environment variable to execute. This technique was used by threat actor Rocke during the exploitation of Linux web servers. This requires the `glibc` package.\n\nUpon successful execution, bash will utilize LD_PRELOAD to load the shared object library `/etc/ld.so.preload`. Output will be via stdout.. Command/Steps: LD_PRELOAD=#{path_to_shared_library} ls\n"
