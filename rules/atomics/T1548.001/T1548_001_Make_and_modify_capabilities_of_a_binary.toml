Test Description: Make and modify [capabilities](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/capabilities.7.html) of a C source code file.\nThe binary doesn't have to modify the UID, but the binary is given the capability to arbitrarily modify it at any time with `setuid(0)`.\nWithout being owned by root, the binary can set the UID to 0.. Command/Steps: cp #{payload} /tmp/cap.c\nmake /tmp/cap\nsudo setcap cap_setuid=ep /tmp/cap\n/tmp/cap\n"
