description = "Detection for specific test 'Domain Account and Group Manipulate' (GUID: a55a22e9-a3d3-42ce-bd48-2653adb8f7a9) of technique T1098 (Account Manipulation). Test Description: Create a random atr-nnnnnnnn account and add it to a domain group (by default, Domain Admins). \n\nThe quickest way to run it is against a domain controller, using `-Session` of `Invoke-AtomicTest`. Alternatively,\nyou need to install PS Module ActiveDirectory (in prereqs) and run the script with appropriare AD privileges to \ncreate the user and alter the group. Automatic installation of the dependency requires an elevated session, \nand is unlikely to work with Powershell Core (untested).\n\nIf you consider running this test against a production Active Directory, the good practise is to create a dedicated\nservice account whose delegation is given onto a dedicated OU for user creation and deletion, as well as delegated\nas group manager of the target group.\n\nExample: `Invoke-AtomicTest -Session $session 'T1098' -TestNames \\\"Domain Account and Group Manipulate\\\" -InputArgs @{\\\"group\\\" = \\\"DNSAdmins\\\" }`. Command/Steps: $x = Get-Random -Minimum 2 -Maximum 99\n$y = Get-Random -Minimum 2 -Maximum 99\n$z = Get-Random -Minimum 2 -Maximum 99\n$w = Get-Random -Minimum 2 -Maxim..."
