description = "Detection for specific test 'GCP - Delete Service Account Key' (GUID: 7ece1dea-49f1-4d62-bdcc-5801e3292510) of technique T1098 (Account Manipulation). Test Description: This Atomic will: \n  - Create a service account\n  - Create a service account key, \n  - Store the result of retrieving a single key for that service account as a variable\n  - Pass that variable for deletion\n  - Delete the service account\n\nThe idea for this Atomic came from a Rule published by the Elastic team.\n\nIdentifies the deletion of an Identity and Access Management (IAM) service account key in Google Cloud Platform (GCP).\nEach service account is associated with two sets of public/private RSA key pairs that are used to authenticate. \nIf a key is deleted, the application will no longer be able to access Google Cloud resources using that key. A security best practice is to rotate your service account keys regularly.\n\nReference: https://github.com/elastic/detection-rules/blob/main/rules/integrations/gcp/impact_gcp_storage_bucket_deleted.toml.
