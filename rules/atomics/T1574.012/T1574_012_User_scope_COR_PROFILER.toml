Test Description: Creates user scope environment variables and CLSID COM object to enable a .NET profiler (COR_PROFILER).\nThe unmanaged profiler DLL (`T1574.012x64.dll`) executes when the CLR is loaded by the Event Viewer process.\nAdditionally, the profiling DLL will inherit the integrity level of Event Viewer bypassing UAC and executing `notepad.exe` with high integrity.\nIf the account used is not a local administrator the profiler DLL will still execute each time the CLR is loaded by a process, however,\nthe notepad process will not execute with high integrity.\n\nReference: https://redcanary.com/blog/cor_profiler-for-persistence/.
