Test Description: Creates system scope environment variables to enable a .NET profiler (COR_PROFILER). System scope environment variables require a restart to take effect.\nThe unmanaged profiler DLL (T1574.012x64.dll`) executes when the CLR is loaded by any process. Additionally, the profiling DLL will inherit the integrity\nlevel of Event Viewer bypassing UAC and executing `notepad.exe` with high integrity. If the account used is not a local administrator the profiler DLL will\nstill execute each time the CLR is loaded by a process, however, the notepad process will not execute with high integrity.\n\nReference: https://redcanary.com/blog/cor_profiler-for-persistence/.
