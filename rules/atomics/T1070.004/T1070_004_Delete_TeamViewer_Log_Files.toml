Test Description: Adversaries may delete TeamViewer log files to hide activity. This should provide a high true-positive alert ration.\nThis test just places the files in a non-TeamViewer folder, a detection would just check for a deletion event matching the TeamViewer\nlog file format of TeamViewer_##.log. Upon execution, no output will be displayed. Use File Explorer to verify the folder was deleted.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/SBousseaden/status/1197524463304290305?s=20.
